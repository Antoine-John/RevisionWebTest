			<p class="define orange">Markets: Structure that allows consumers and producers to exchange goods or services.</li>
    		<p class="define blue">Law of Demand: There is a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded. Individual demand represents the quantity of a good or service a consumer is willing to buy at a given price level in a given time interval. Market demand represents the sum of all individual demand in the market.</p>

    		<p class="define red">Law of supply: There is a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied. As with demand, individual producers supply is the quantity of a good or service a producer is willing and able to supply at a given price level in a given time period. Market supply is therefore the sum of all the individual producer supply in a market.</p>
