        				<h2>Price Elasticity of demand (PED)</h2>

        				<p class="define blue">Price elasticity of demand is a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price, along a given demand curve.</p>

        				<p class="define green">PED is calculated using the following equation: </br> (% &#916; quantity demanded) &#247; (% &#916; price)</p>

        				<p>The value of PED is usually negative as a decrease in the price usually leads to an increase in quantity demanded and vice versa. However usually the modulus (size of) the PED is all that is looked at.</p>

        				<p class="define purple">
        					<b>0 < PED < 1:</b>
        					<img src="./Images/PED_inelastic.png">
        					If the PED is less than 1 but greater than 0 then the demand is price <i>inelastic</i>. This means that a change in price leads to a relatively small change in quantity demanded.
        					<br>
        					<b>&infin; > PED > 1:</b>
        					<img src="./Images/PED_elastic.png">
        					If the PED is greater than 1 but less than &infin; then demand for the product is price <i>elastic</i>. This means that a change in price leads to a comparitively large change in quantity demanded.
        					<br>
        					<b>PED = 1:</b>
        					<img src="./Images/PED_unitary.png">
        					If the PED is equal to one then the product has unit elastic demand meaning that a change in price leads to an equal change in the quantity demanded.
        					<br>
        					<b>PED = &infin;:</b>
        					<img src="./Images/PED_perfectly_inelastic.png">
        					If the PED is equal to &infin; then the product is perfectly price inelastic; any change in price leads to a complete loss of demand.
        					<br>
        					<b>PED = 0:</b>
        					<img src="./Images/PED_perfectly_elastic.png">
        					IF PED is equal to 0 then demand is perfectly price elastic, any change in price leads to no change in quantity demanded.
        				</p>

        				<p class="define yellow">It is important to note that the PED varies along a straight line demand curve. Along the demand curve PED falls. This makes sense because consumers are more concerned about when an expensive good rises in price than if a cheap good increases its price.</p>

        				<h3>Determinants of PED</h3>
        				<p class="define blue"><b>Number and closeness of substitutes</b>: the more substitutes there are for a product, the more elastic will be the demand for it. Moreover, the closer the substitutes available, the more elastic will be the demand.</p>
        				<p class="define green"><b>Degree of necessity and breadth of definition of the product</b>: the more a good is considered a necessity, the more likely it will have an elastic PED. Conversely, if we narrow our definition of a product, the more likely it will be price elastic as there will tend to be more alternatives.</p>
        				<p class="define orange"><b>Time frame under consideration</b>: in the short run demand tends to be inelastic as consumers are unable to move to substitutes, but in the long run it becomes more elastic.</p>
        				<p class="define purple"><b>Proportion of income spent on product</b>: the higher the proportion of income spent on a product the more price sensitive consumers are, therefore the higher the PED. </p>

        				<h3>Applications of price elasticity of demand</h3>
        				<p>For firms, knowing the PED of their product is very useful as it indicates to them where to set price to maximise revenue. Generally if the good is price inelastic, firms should raise prices to maximise revenue whereas if the good is price elastic firms should lower prices to maximise revenue.<br>For the government, knowing the PED of a good is useful to understand the effect of adding an indirect tax (covered in market failure).</p>

        				<h3>Cross price elasticity of demand (XED)</h3>

        				<p class="define blue">Defined as the responsiveness of demand (shifts of the demand curve) for one good to a change in the price of another good.</p>

        				<p class="define green">XED is calculated using the following equation: </br> (% &#916; quantity demanded in good X) &#247; (% &#916; price of good Y)</p>

        				<p class="define orange">If two goods are substitutes, then a positive change in price of one good will lead to a positive change in quantity demanded for the other good. Therefore substitute goods have a positive XED value. By the same logic, complementary goods have a negative XED value. A high XED value infers that the two goods are close substitutes whilst a low XED value infers that the two goods are poor substitutes. Moreover, products that are very close complements will have a lower negative value than products that are not so close. An XED value of 0 or infinite means that the two goods are unrelated.</p>

        				<p>It is important that firms know the XED values for the products they produce. It is important for them to understand how a change in the price of substitute goods will affect the demand for their product, and vice versa. Additionally it is important for firms to know how a change in price of complementary goods will affect the demand for their good and vice versa.</p>

        				<h3>Income elasticity of demand (YED)</h3>

        				<p class="define blue">Defined as the responsiveness of demand to a change inincome.</p>

        				<p class="define green">YED is calculated using the following equation: </br> (% &#916; quantity demanded) &#247; (% &#916; income)</p>

        				<p class="define orange">A normal good is a good whose consumption increases as income increases. Therefore normal goods have a positive YED value. Inferior goods are goods whose conumption decreases as income increases. These goods have a negative YED value.</p>

        				<p class="define yellow">If the percentage change in quantity demanded is lower than the percentage change in income then the good is considered to be income inelastic. Necessity goods tend to be income inelastic. Conversely in the percentage change in quantiy demanded is higher than the change in income the good is considered to income elastic. Superior goods tend to be income inelastic.</p>

        				<p>From IB syllabus: Examine the implications for producers and for the economy of a relatively low YED for primary products, a relatively higher YED for manufactured products and an even higher YED for services.</p>

        				<h3>Price elasticity of supply (PES)</h3>

        				<p class="define red">Defined as the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price along a given supply curve.</p>

        				<p class="define green">PES is calculated using the following formula:<br>(% &#916; quantity supplied) &#247; (% &#916; price)</p>

        				<p class="define blue">
        					<b>IF PES = &infin;</b>:
        					<img src="./Images/PES_perfectly_elastic.png">
        					If PES is equal to infinite then any change in price will lead to zero being supplied, PES is perfectly elastic.
        					<br><b>IF PES = 0</b>:
        					<img src="./Images/PES_perfectly_inelastic.png">
        					IF PES is equal to zero then any change in price will have no effect on quantity supplied, PES is perfectly inelastic.
        					<br><b>Other cases</b>:
        					<img src="./Images/PES_multi.png">
        					The supply curve is unit elastic if the PES is equal to 1. This happens if the supply curve starts at the origin as an such as S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>. The Supply curve is inelastic if PES is between 1 and 0. This happens when the supply curve starts at the x-axis, such as S<sub>3</sub>. Finally, supply is preice elastic if PES is between one and infinite. This happens when the supply curve starts at the y-axis, such as S<sub>4</sub>.

        			<div>
        				<h3>Determinants of PES</h3>

        				<p class="define green">Time: Generally the longer the time frame the more elastic PES becomes. This is because in the short run firms may not be able to increase their supply output by very much as they cannot quickly increase the number of FOPs they employ.</p>
        				<p class="define purple">Mobility of factors of production: If FOPs can be moved from one productive use to another then PES will be elastic. </p>
        				<p class="define orange">Unused capacity: If a firm is not operating at full capacity, it will be relatively easier to increase output to reflect an increase in price. This means that PES will be quite price elastic. </p>
        				<p class="define yellow">Ability to store stocks: If a firm can store large quantities of their stock they will be more able to react to a change in price. The higher the ability to store stocks the higher the PES.</p>

						<h3>Commodities</h3>

						<p class="define grey">Commodities, or primary commodities, is a term associated with raw materials.</p>

						<p class="define blue">Primary commodities tend to have a price inelastic PED because they tend to be necessities to the consumers who buy them and because of the low number of substitutes. Coversely, manufactured products tend to have a high PED due to the high number of substitutes</p>

						<p class="define red">Commodities tend to have inelastic supply as a change in price cannot lead to a proportionately large increase in quantity supplied. Manufactured products tend to have more elastic supply as it is easier to change quantity supplied in response to a change in price.</p>
